Homework 1 – Prithee
Design Summary

The program is split into two parts:

Main.java
- Controls the game loop.
- Prints the sonnet prompt.
- Reads user input.
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses.
- Ends the game after 3 correct or 3 incorrect answers.

PritheeUtils.java
- Contains all non-interactive logic.
- Tokenizes the sonnet text.
- Normalizes words for comparison.
- Selects a random missing-word index.
- Builds the prompt with underscores.

Design Choices
- Logic is separated from user interaction so it can be unit tested.
- Word comparison is case-insensitive and ignores punctuation.
- Immediate repetition of the same missing word is avoided.

Testing
- JUnit tests target methods in PritheeUtils.
- User input and full game flow are not unit tested.
